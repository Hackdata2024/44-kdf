# YogaAI Application

## Team
- **BACKEND:** Tisha Singhal
- **AI MODEL:** Sanya Tiwari
- **FRONTEND:** Tannu Bharadwaj, Saloni Rai

## Tech Used
- **Frontend:** ReactJS
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Machine Learning and Computer Vision
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow (Machine Learning), OpenCV (Computer Vision)

## Idea Description
YogaAI is an application that utilizes artificial intelligence to detect and analyze yoga postures. The team has developed a virtual AI yoga trainer incorporating pose recognition tools. The application provides real-time feedback on the accuracy of a user's pose, helping them to track their fitness goals.

## How to Run the Project
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the project: `npm start`

## Deployment Link (If Deployed)
Visit the deployed YogaAI application [here](https://yoga-pose-v13.netlify.app/).

## Core Code Explanation
- **Frontend:** The frontend of the application is developed using ReactJS. Explore the code in the `frontend` directory to understand the user interface and interactions.

- **AI Model:** The AI model responsible for pose recognition is located in the `classification` folder. The Python code utilizes TensorFlow for machine learning and OpenCV for computer vision. Dive into this folder to understand how the AI interprets and analyzes yoga postures.
